After some time I have found out about JavaScript and Web Development and wellâ€¦ a lot has changed since then. I have enrolled in a few programming courses and did many hours of coding exercises. At some point I made decision to quit law studies and focus fully on my programming career. I have few smaller and bigger freelance projects on my account and currently I am working for Evolution Company as a Frontend Developer. Besides programming I am person, who loves contact with others. That is why I find working with other more experienced developers (and not only developers) very fascinating and it brings me a lot of joy and motivation at the same time. I believe that with the right people, we can do absolutely amazing things and it also brings a lot of drive and satisfaction. Outside work I am very sport oriented person. I like to play almost every sport which brings me to play football at one time and the second I find myself at chessboard trying to find the best outcome for my game"
